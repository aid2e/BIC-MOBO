# BIC-MOBO [Under construction]

An application of MOBO techniques to the ePIC Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC). As the
BIC design is largely finalized and optimal, this exercise has two purposes:

  1. As a simple test of the AID2E framework to gain familiarity with the tool;
  2. And as a demonstration of the framework, showing that it converges to a
     reasonable answer.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11.5
- Conda or Mamba
